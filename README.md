This will be an project to demonstrate DOM manipulation abilities in particular.
When mousing over the affected area, the color will gradually get darker.
I plan on making options to change color as well.

Bugs to fix: 
When changing size of board, you have to select a color before it works
Still need to add "eraser" functionality
Smaller and smallest size are showing the same results
