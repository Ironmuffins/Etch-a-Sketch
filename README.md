This will be an project to demonstrate DOM manipulation abilities in particular.
When mousing over the affected area, the color will gradually get darker.
I plan on making options to change color as well.

Bugs to fix: 
When resetting board, the color no longer highlights with mouseover
When creating more than 16 boxes, they are too small
