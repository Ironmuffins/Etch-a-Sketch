This projects demonstrates my growing skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
Effectivley manipulating the DOM was particularly important.

New features:
When selecting the size you already have selected, it no longer erases user markings

Existing functions:
When mousing over the grid, the color is changed to the users selection for each box.
User can select between three sizes (Large, Small, Smallest), which creates a grid of that size.
User can select between three different colors.
Eraser button erases previously colored boxes.
Clear button erases all marked boxes.

Functions to possibly add in future update: 
Ability to change size of grid by inputing an exact number of rows/columns.
When mousing over the selected area, the color will gradually get darker.
Rainbow color which randomly marks colors.
A color wheel to select any color.
