This projects demonstrates my growing skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
Effectivley manipulating the DOM was particularly important.

Current functions:
User can select between three different sizes (Large, Small, Smallest), which creates a grid of the correct size.
User can select between three different colors.
When mousing over the grid, the color is changed to the users selection for each box.
Eraser button erases previously colored boxes.
Clear button erases all marked boxes.

Functions to possibly add in future update: 
When mousing over the affected area, the color will gradually get darker.
Rainbow color which randomly marks colors.
A color wheel to select any color.
Ability to change size of grid by selecting an exact number of rows/columns.
